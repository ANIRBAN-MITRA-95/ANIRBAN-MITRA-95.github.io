I am Anirban Mitra, a Ph.D Scholar advised by <a href = "https://manugupta-ai.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Manu K. Gupta</a> at Department of Management Studies, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee. I have completed M.Tech in Industrial Engineering and Management from Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology, West Bengal. My research interests are broadly Game Theory and Mechanism Design. Apart from these I am also interested in Queueing Theory and stochastic processes. 

 On these pages I will be sharing with you about my research interests, publications, conference presentations and other academic activities.
